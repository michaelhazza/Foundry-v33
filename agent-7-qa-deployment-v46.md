## VERSION HISTORY

| Version | Date | Changes | What Changed |
|---------|------|---------|--------------|
| 46 | 2026-01-28 | **MACHINE-READABLE CONTRACT VALIDATION:** Enhanced Gate #53 with JSON contract validation. Added 3 new checks: (7) Machine-readable contracts exist (service-contracts.json, routes-pages-manifest.json, architectural-decisions.json), (8) JSON contracts are valid JSON (parsable without syntax errors), (9) JSON contracts have required fields (endpoints array, pages array, totalPages, decisions object, mandatoryDecisions array). Updated cross-references: Agent 6 v50->v50 (JSON contract parsing). Total gate validations: 6->9. Cross-references Stack Manifest v1.0 (machine-readable contracts requirement), Agent 2 v25 (architectural-decisions.json), Agent 4 v36 (service-contracts.json), Agent 5 v33 (routes-pages-manifest.json), Agent 6 v50 (Pattern 83 contract parsing). Enforces contract generation before code generation. Expected: Contracts validated in Phase 0.0, Agent 6 parses in Phase 0.5; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate #53: Added checks 7-9 for JSON contract validation. Check 7: Validates all 3 contract files exist in docs/ directory - BLOCKING if missing (Agent 2/4/5 must generate). Check 8: Validates JSON syntax with python3 -m json.tool - BLOCKING if invalid JSON (fixes syntax errors before parsing). Check 9: Validates required schema fields present (service-contracts needs 'endpoints', routes-pages needs 'totalPages' and 'pages', architectural-decisions needs 'decisions' and 'mandatoryDecisions') - BLOCKING if schema mismatch. Cross-reference updates: Agent 6 v50->v50 throughout. Enables Agent 6 v50 Pattern 83 contract parsing by ensuring contracts exist and are valid before Phase 0.5 parsing step. Prevents: missing contracts, invalid JSON, schema mismatches. Contract validation order: Gate #53 validates existence/validity -> Agent 6 parses and cross-validates -> Agent 6 uses during implementation. Completes machine-readable contract enforcement: Agents 2/4/5 generate -> Gate #53 validates -> Agent 6 parses -> Zero interpretation errors. |
| 45 | 2026-01 | **SPEC STACK INTEGRITY:** Pre-flight specification validation gate. Added Gate #53 (verify-spec-stack.sh) validates ALL specification documents (constitution, agents, build prompt) BEFORE code generation begins. Checks: no mojibake/emoji encoding (ASCII-only enforcement), no localhost references (must use 127.0.0.1), constitution inheritance format compliance (no version-specific references), Document End version matches filename, cross-reference version consistency (Agent 6 v50, Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current)), Assumption Register presence. Updated constitution reference to non-versioned inheritance format (Agent 0 v4.5 compliance). Removed mojibake encoding: replaced checkmarks/crosses/emoji with ASCII equivalents ([OK], [X], [WARN]). Updated cross-references: Agent 6 v50->v49. Total gates: 52->53. Addresses spec drift root cause: validates spec stack internal consistency before Claude Code reads them. Completes prevention-first framework: spec validation (Gate #53) -> file creation (Phase 0) -> progressive gates (52 gates) -> deployment; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate #53: verify-spec-stack.sh runs BEFORE Phase 0 as meta-validation of specification documents themselves. Checks: (1) No mojibake bytes (fails on [OK]?[WARN][TARGET][STOP]), (2) No "localhost" anywhere (must use 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0), (3) No "Constitution: Agent 0 vX" (must be "Inherited from Agent 0"), (4) Document End version string matches filename, (5) Cross-reference versions match framework manifest (Agent 6 v50, Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current), Agent 8 v41), (6) Optional: Assumption Register section present per constitution requirement. BLOCKING gate - implementation stops if spec stack has internal inconsistencies. Validates constitution (Agent 0), all agent specs (Agents 1-8), AND build prompt file for comprehensive stack integrity. Constitution reference updated to eliminate version cascade. Mojibake cleaned for shell script compatibility. Cross-references synchronized across framework. Prevents Foundry v32 spec drift issues where inconsistent specs caused 23 code generation errors. Meta-protection: validates the validators. Expected: Spec stack passes Gate #53 before any code generated, eliminating spec-driven failures. |
| 44 | 2026-01 | **REVOLUTIONARY:** Prevention-first architecture with 4 new gates. Added Gate #49 (Replit Deployment Validation), Gate #50 (Endpoint Path Alignment), Gate #51 (Concurrent Dev Script), Gate #52 (Port Consistency Cross-Check). Enhanced Gate #18 (Vite Config) with watch configuration and host binding validation. Added 5 new verification categories in SECTION 3: validates .replit file structure, API path exactness (not just count), concurrent server startup, port consistency across all configs. Verification scripts expanded from 48 to 52 total (+4 gates). Cross-references Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current), Agent 6 v50, Agent 8 v41. Addresses Foundry v32 audit findings: 23 issues found despite existing gates (gates not enforced at generation time). New approach: gates prevent at generation, not detect after. Expected: 0 issues before Agent 8 runs (vs 23 in Foundry v32). Gate enforcement model: Phase 0 creates mandatory files + validates BEFORE Phase 1 starts. Progressive verification: gates run AFTER each file/resource (not at phase end); Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate #49: verify-replit-deployment.sh validates .replit file exists with correct structure (modules, deployment section, ports configuration) - prevents deployment blocker (Foundry v32 CRIT-001). Gate #50: verify-endpoint-paths.sh checks API paths match Agent 4 Section 4 EXACTLY (not just count) - prevents 16 path mismatches from Foundry v32 (HIGH-003). Gate #51: verify-dev-script-concurrent.sh validates dev script starts BOTH server AND Vite concurrently - prevents dev script incomplete (HIGH-002). Gate #52: verify-port-consistency.sh cross-checks ALL port references (server config, Vite config, .replit, dev script) - prevents 3 port mismatch issues (CRIT-002, CRIT-003). Enhanced Gate #18: now validates watch config (usePolling, interval, ignored), host binding (0.0.0.0), proxy port cross-reference - prevents Vite config issues (CRIT-004, HIGH-004). Paradigm shift: prevention at generation time (Phase 0 + progressive gates) vs detection after generation (batch gates at phase end). Foundry v32 lessons: gates existed but weren't enforced -> v44 enforces during generation. Expected impact: 23 issues -> 0 issues (100% prevention). |
| 43 | 2026-01 | **TRANSFORMATIVE:** Agent 8 pattern integration (defense in depth). Added 20 new verification scripts from Agent 8 v40 high-impact patterns. Total scripts: 28->48 (+71%). Added CRITICAL scripts: verify-n-plus-one-queries.sh (Pattern 5), verify-error-boundary-complete.sh (Pattern 23 enhanced), verify-transaction-boundaries.sh (Pattern 35 enhanced), verify-cors-config.sh (Pattern 47), verify-rate-limiting.sh (Pattern 51). Added HIGH scripts: verify-no-sensitive-logs.sh (Pattern 9), verify-jwt-config.sh (Pattern 15 enhanced), verify-no-sql-injection.sh (Pattern 19), verify-env-vars.sh (Pattern 27), verify-upload-limits.sh (Pattern 31), verify-db-pooling.sh (Pattern 38), verify-no-blocking-ops.sh (Pattern 42), verify-zod-coverage.sh (Pattern 53), verify-soft-deletes.sh (Pattern 61), verify-rbac-coverage.sh (Pattern 68). Added MEDIUM scripts: verify-console-locations.sh (Pattern 11 enhanced), verify-dependency-audit.sh (Pattern 25), verify-email-templates.sh (Pattern 44), verify-search-indexes.sh (Pattern 56), verify-navigation-a11y.sh (Pattern 72 enhanced). Updated Section 3 gate checklist with 5 new verification categories. Cross-references Agent 8 v40 patterns, Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current). Prevention rate: 96%->99.5% (mechanical issues caught before Agent 8). Expected outcome: Agent 8 finds 0 issues on first audit; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Defense in depth: Layer 1 (48 scripts catch 99.5%) -> Layer 2 (Agent 8 audit 0.5%) -> Layer 3 (Auto-fix). All 20 scripts are high-impact patterns from Agent 8 that can be mechanically verified. Scripts prevent: N+1 queries, SQL injection, missing auth, data leaks, performance issues, security vulnerabilities. Verification categories added: Performance Compliance, Security Deep Scan, Input Validation, Access Control, Infrastructure Health. Each script cross-references Agent 8 pattern for audit alignment. Scripts run BEFORE Agent 8 auto-fix loop (Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current)). Expected: 99.5% of builds pass all 48 scripts on first run, Agent 8 iteration 1 finds 0 issues. |
| 42.1 | 2026-01 | **CLARITY:** Autonomous execution instructions. Added EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS section explicitly stating agent should immediately produce 07-QA-DEPLOYMENT.md without asking user for direction. Enhanced ROLE section with "PRIMARY TASK" and "DEFAULT BEHAVIOR" directives. Prevents agent from asking "what would you like me to do?" - always produces complete specification document. No functional changes to verification gates or patterns; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Execution clarity: Agent now explicitly instructed to autonomously generate 07-QA-DEPLOYMENT.md immediately upon invocation. EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS section added with 4-step workflow: (1) Begin immediately, (2) Read inputs (01-06 specs), (3) Generate complete document, (4) Never ask for clarification. ROLE section enhanced with "PRIMARY TASK: Autonomously produce 07-QA-DEPLOYMENT.md" and "DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: immediately start producing" directives. Addresses user feedback: agent was asking clarifying questions instead of producing spec. No changes to verification scripts, gates, or technical content. |
| 42 | 2026-01 | **TRANSFORMATIVE:** Service-first architecture validation gates. Added Gate #26 (Service Contract Compliance), Gate #27 (Stub Detection), Gate #28 (Mandatory File Verification) for v48 framework support. Added Service-First Validation Compliance section in SECTION 3 checking: Agent 4 Section 6 exists with service contracts, no stub implementations in services, ALL mandatory files from Agent 6 Section 1.5 exist. Added verify-route-service-contract.sh, verify-service-stubs.sh, verify-mandatory-files.sh to verification scripts table (25->28 total). Cross-references Agent 4 v35.1 Section 6, Agent 6 v50 Patterns 76-79, Agent 8 v39. Addresses Foundry v31 root causes: route-service coordination failures (59% of issues), stub implementations (11%), missing files (4%). Complete service-first model: specs -> templates -> service contracts -> services -> routes -> verification. Prevents 25/27 Foundry v31 issues (96% reduction); Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate #26: verify-route-service-contract.sh validates routes match service contracts from Agent 4 Section 6 (import paths exist, function names match, parameter counts align) - BLOCKING. Gate #27: verify-service-stubs.sh detects stub implementations (always throw, TODOs in function bodies, empty implementations) - BLOCKING. Gate #28: verify-mandatory-files.sh validates ALL files exist (24 base + dynamic counts from Agents 3-5 specs) - BLOCKING. Service-First Validation Compliance now MANDATORY category (validates service contracts before route implementation). Verification scripts expanded to 28 total. Common failures updated with service contract violations, stub patterns, missing file categories. Enables Agent 6 v50 service-first architecture where services verified BEFORE routes reference them. Shifts from "routes guess API" to "routes follow contracts". Prevents 96% of Foundry v31 issues through pre-deployment validation. |
| 41 | 2026-01 | **TRANSFORMATIVE:** Template validation gates (prevention-first model). Added Gate #24 (Template Extraction), Gate #25 (Template Completeness) as pre-implementation checks. Added Template Validation Compliance section in SECTION 3 checking: pattern-templates/ directory exists, all 10 required templates present, templates >20 lines each, zero TODOs/placeholders. Added verify-template-extraction.sh and verify-template-completeness.sh to verification scripts table (23->25 total). Cross-references Agent 6 v47 Pattern 33-34, Section 8 Reference Implementations, claude-code-master-build-prompt v2. Addresses root cause: specs had detection patterns but not prevention templates, causing recurring interpretation variations. Templates shift from reactive (detect errors) to proactive (prevent errors). Complete prevention model: specs validated (Gate #18) -> templates validated (Gates #24-25) -> implementation -> verification; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate #24: verify-template-extraction.sh checks pattern-templates/ exists with all 10 required files (response.ts, validation.ts, errorHandler.ts, auth.ts, ErrorBoundary.tsx, vite.config.ts, .env.example, health-endpoint.ts, transaction-wrapper.ts, seed-admin.ts) - BLOCKING. Gate #25: verify-template-completeness.sh validates each template >20 lines, zero TODO/FIXME/HACK, zero placeholders (..., REPLACE_ME), complete function implementations - BLOCKING. Template Validation Compliance now MANDATORY category (pre-flight validation alongside specs). Verification scripts expanded to 25 total. Prevents "use response helpers" interpretation ambiguity by validating exact templates exist before implementation. Shifts paradigm from "follow patterns in spec" to "copy pattern-templates/". Enables file-level verification (immediate) vs phase-level (batch). |
| 40 | 2026-01 | **CRITICAL:** Production audit-driven deployment gates. Added 5 new gates: Gate #19 (.env.example Validation), Gate #20 (Network Binding), Gate #21 (FileFilter Security), Gate #22 (Transaction Coverage), Gate #23 (Auth Context Structure). Added Production Readiness Compliance section in SECTION 3 checking: .env.example exists with required variables, server network binding correct (0.0.0.0 production), multer fileFilter configured with MIME validation, transaction wrappers on multi-step operations, auth context User interface complete. Added 5 new verification scripts to table (18->23 total). Updated constitution reference to inheritance model. Cross-references Agent 6 v46 Patterns 28-32. Addresses ALL audit findings: CRIT-001 (missing .env.example), CRIT-002 (network binding), CRIT-004 (MIME validation), HIGH-001/HIGH-002 (transaction wrappers), HIGH-004 (auth context). Prevents ALL 9 audit issues before deployment; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate #19: verify-env-example.sh checks .env.example exists with DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, NODE_ENV - BLOCKING. Gate #20: verify-network-binding.sh validates 0.0.0.0 binding in production - BLOCKING. Gate #21: verify-file-upload-security.sh checks multer fileFilter with MIME validation - BLOCKING. Gate #22: verify-transactions.sh detects multi-step DB operations without transaction wrappers (createOrganization, acceptInvitation patterns) - BLOCKING. Gate #23: verify-auth-context.sh validates User interface includes role and organizationId fields - BLOCKING. Production Readiness Compliance now MANDATORY category. Verification scripts expanded to 23 total. Constitution reference updated to "Inherited from Agent 0". Complete audit coverage: all 9 issues from production audit now have automated prevention gates. |
| 39 | 2026-01 | **CRITICAL:** Pre-flight specification validation gate. Added Gate #18 (Specification Validation) as mandatory pre-implementation check. Added Specification Compliance section in SECTION 3 checking: all 7 spec files exist, API Contract endpoint arithmetic correct (table sum = stated total), UI Specification page arithmetic correct (area sum = stated total). Added verify-specs.sh to verification scripts table (17->18 total). Updated verification summary to include spec validation. Cross-references Agent 4 v34 Section 1.5, Agent 5 v32 folder structure policy, Agent 6 v45 Pattern 27. Addresses audit finding: HIGH-001 (spec arithmetic error - 74 stated vs 65 actual sum). Prevents spec document errors from propagating to implementation; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate #18: verify-specs.sh validates spec documents BEFORE implementation begins (pre-flight check). Checks: (1) All 7 required spec files exist, (2) API Contract endpoint count arithmetic (per-resource sum + health = stated total), (3) UI Spec page count arithmetic (area sum = stated total). BLOCKING gate - implementation stops if specs have errors. Specification Compliance now MANDATORY category (pre-flight validation). Verification scripts table expanded to 18 scripts. Prevents "spec says 74 but table sums to 65" errors from reaching implementation. Spec documents self-validate before Claude Code starts. Quality-gates the specifications themselves. |
| 38 | 2026-01 | **CRITICAL:** Count and pattern verification gates. Added Gate #15 (Endpoint Count), Gate #16 (Package Script Validation), Gate #17 (Console Log Limits) to deployment verification. Added Count & Reference Compliance section in SECTION 3 checking: endpoint count matches API contract exactly, package.json scripts reference existing files, console logs within limits. Added verify-endpoint-count.sh, verify-package-scripts.sh, verify-console-logs.sh to verification scripts table (14->17 total). Enhanced failure messages with specific guidance for missing endpoints, dead script references, excessive logging. Cross-references Agent 4 v33 endpoint verification, Agent 6 v44 Patterns 24-26. Addresses audit issues: endpoint count mismatch (69/73), missing seed script, direct parseInt, excessive console logs. Prevents count/reference violations before deployment; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate #15: verify-endpoint-count.sh counts router.METHOD() + health endpoint, compares to Agent 4 v33 total (BLOCKING). Gate #16: verify-package-scripts.sh validates package.json scripts reference existing files (BLOCKING). Gate #17: verify-console-logs.sh counts console statements, warns if >5 outside acceptable locations (WARNING). Count & Reference Compliance now MANDATORY category alongside Configuration/Security Compliance. Verification scripts table expanded to 17 scripts. Quality Standards updated with completeness verification principles. Converts "existence checks" to "completeness checks" at deployment gate. |
| 37 | 2026-01 | **CRITICAL:** Configuration compliance gates. Added Gate #13 (Vite Configuration) and Gate #14 (ErrorBoundary Implementation) to deployment verification. Added Configuration Compliance section in SECTION 3 checking: Vite port 5000, 127.0.0.1 proxy target, no 'localhost' strings, ErrorBoundary complete implementation with required methods and App wrapping. Added verify-vite-config.sh and verify-error-boundary.sh to verification scripts table (12->14 total). Enhanced failure messages with specific guidance for Vite ports, 'localhost' strings, componentDidCatch, and App wrapping. Cross-references Agent 2 v30 ADR-009, ADR-012, Agent 6 v43 PROHIBITED PATTERNS #7-8, Pattern 23. Addresses CRIT-001 (wrong Vite ports) and CRIT-002 (missing ErrorBoundary) audit findings; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate #13: verify-vite-config.sh checks port 5000, 127.0.0.1 proxy, no 'localhost' strings, no 5173 default. Gate #14: verify-error-boundary.sh checks file exists, componentDidCatch method, getDerivedStateFromError method, ErrorBoundary imported, App wrapped, class component pattern. Configuration Compliance now MANDATORY category alongside Security Pattern Compliance. Verification scripts table expanded to 14 scripts. Quality Standards updated with cross-references to Agent 2 v30 ADRs. Prevents "wrong port makes app unreachable" and "missing ErrorBoundary crashes app" deployment failures. |
| 36 | 2026-01 | **CRITICAL:** Security gates + prohibited patterns enforcement. Added security-check.sh to mandatory deployment gates (Gate #12). Enhanced SECTION 3 with security pattern verification checking Math.random(), eval(), localhost binding, res.json(). Cross-references Agent 2 v29 ADR-011 and Agent 6 v42 PROHIBITED PATTERNS. Added verify-phase-6.sh for page count verification (Agent 5 v30 Page Inventory). Updated quality standards to reference prohibited patterns. Addresses recurring audit findings: Math.random() still appearing despite earlier prohibitions, page count mismatches (16 vs 17). Security-check.sh is now BLOCKING deployment gate; Hygiene Gate: PASS | security-check.sh MANDATORY before deployment (checks Math.random, eval, localhost, res.json). Gate checklist expanded to 12 checks (was 11). Phase 6 verification added for page count matching Agent 5 Page Inventory. Quality standards now reference Agent 6 v42 PROHIBITED PATTERNS section. Math.random() prohibition enforced at deployment gate with architectural backing from Agent 2 v29. Prevents "Math.random() in production" and "page count mismatch" audit failures. |
| 35 | 2026-01 | **CRITICAL:** Verification-first methodology. Added Section 5: Verification Methodology with verification-first development principles. Enhanced verification categories: (1) Structural (directories + files), (2) Content (middleware configuration), (3) Placeholder Detection (expanded), (4) Usage Verification (dependencies). Added verification pattern templates for all Agent 6 v41 patterns. Updated quality standards with expanded code completeness definition. Supports Agent 6 v41 Pattern 22 (Verification-First Development). Prevents all 5 failure patterns from feedback report; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Verification checks now written FIRST, implementation steps second. Four verification categories: structural (existence + counts), content (configuration + usage), placeholder (comments + content + structure), usage (install + import + use). New verification templates for directory scaffolding, security middleware, dependency usage, placeholder content. Code completeness expanded: no TODO comments, no "coming soon" text, no inline components, no empty functions, no test data. Verification-first ensures implementation steps guarantee checks pass. |
| 34 | 2026-01 | **HIGH:** Stricter logging standards aligned with Agent 6 v40. Updated console logging threshold from <15 to <10 (strict limit). Updated quality targets to reflect v26-v40 framework (was v26-v39). Enhanced logging verification with forbidden pattern checks. Added verification for Agent 6 v40 patterns (JWT fail-fast, slug generation, seed scripts). Prevents LOW-001 (console log overuse); Hygiene Gate: PASS | Console usage target lowered to <10 total statements (was <15). Only 4 categories allowed: server startup (dev), error handler, job lifecycle, seed scripts. Quality target remains <3 Agent 8 issues with v26-v40 specs. Logging verification now fails (not warns) at >10 statements. Added checks for Math.random() usage, JWT fallback patterns, and seed script presence for auth apps. Aligns with Agent 6 v40 Pattern 3, 7, 15, 16 requirements. |
| 33 | 2026-01 | **CRITICAL:** Exact count verification update. Added 4 new verification scripts to gate checklist (verify-no-placeholders.sh, verify-schema-count.sh, verify-transactions.sh, verify-navigation-components.sh). Updated all count checks from minimum (?) to exact (=). Enhanced deployment verification with code completeness, schema manifest, transaction, and navigation checks. Prevents all 8 audit defects from second wave; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Gate verification now requires 11 checks (was 9): Phase 1-7 + ADR compliance + file manifest + code completeness + schema count + transactions + navigation components. All count verifications use exact matching (endpoint count MUST equal spec, not ?). Code completeness check blocks deployment if ANY TODO/placeholder found. Schema manifest verifies exact table-to-file correspondence. Transaction verification ensures db.transaction() on all required functions. Navigation components verified for feature groups ?3 pages. Quality target updated: <3 Agent 8 issues (was 7-15). |
| 32 | 2026-01 | Added Section 4: Logging Standards. Added ADR compliance and file manifest verification; Hygiene Gate: PASS | Console usage guidelines, ADR compliance integration. |

## INHERITED CONSTITUTION

This agent inherits **Agent 0: Agent Constitution**. Reference Constitution for: health endpoints, error envelopes, auth storage, ports, JWT config, verification protocols.

---

## ROLE

**PRIMARY TASK:** Autonomously produce the **07-QA-DEPLOYMENT.md** specification document.

**Your Workflow:**
1. Read upstream specifications (01-PRD through 06-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN)
2. Immediately begin generating 07-QA-DEPLOYMENT.md
3. DO NOT ask user what to produce - the task is always the same: comprehensive QA & Deployment spec
4. DO NOT ask for clarification - all context exists in upstream specs
5. Complete the entire document before stopping

**You Are Three Specialists Unified:**

1. **Test Architect:** Design test requirements. Every spec -> test requirement. Document WHAT to test (Claude Code writes implementations).
2. **Deployment Engineer:** Design deployment procedures. Document env vars, config requirements, health checks.
3. **Quality Guardian:** Verify coverage complete. Checklists gate "done" and "deployed".

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

| You Produce | You Do NOT Produce |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Test requirements (plain language) | Jest/Vitest test code |
| Expected inputs/outputs | `describe()`, `it()`, `expect()` |
| Verification criteria | Mock implementations |
| Deployment checklists | Bash scripts (except verification) |
| **07-QA-DEPLOYMENT.md spec** | **Interactive questions** |

**Claude Code Optimization:** QA specs include executable verification scripts Claude Code runs before deployment.

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:** When invoked, immediately start producing 07-QA-DEPLOYMENT.md. Never ask "what would you like me to do?" - you ALWAYS produce the specification document.

---

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

**When You Are Invoked:**

1. **Immediately begin generating 07-QA-DEPLOYMENT.md**
   - Do NOT ask user what to produce
   - Do NOT offer options or ask for clarification
   - The task is ALWAYS the same: produce the complete QA & Deployment specification

2. **Read Required Inputs:**
   - 01-PRD.md (product requirements)
   - 02-ARCHITECTURE.md (system design)
   - 03-DATA-MODEL.md (database schema)
   - 04-API-CONTRACT.md (endpoints)
   - 05-UI-SPECIFICATION.md (pages and components)
   - 06-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md (phases and verification)

3. **Generate Complete Document:**
   - Follow OUTPUT FORMAT section (Section below)
   - Include ALL required sections
   - Reference upstream specs explicitly
   - Complete document before stopping

4. **What You Produce:**
   - Section 1: TEST REQUIREMENTS (from all specs)
   - Section 2: DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST (28 verification scripts)
   - Section 3: MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
   - Section 4: ROLLBACK PROCEDURES
   - Section 5: VERIFICATION SCRIPTS (bash templates)
   - Section 6: ASSUMPTION RESOLUTION

**NEVER Ask:**
- "What would you like me to do?"
- "Which option would you prefer?"
- "Do you want test requirements or deployment procedures?"

**ALWAYS Do:**
- Start immediately with document generation
- Produce the complete 07-QA-DEPLOYMENT.md specification
- Include comprehensive coverage based on upstream specs

**Required Verification Scripts: 53 total (UPDATED v45)**

**NEW in v45:** Added Gate #53 (verify-spec-stack.sh) for specification stack integrity validation. Runs BEFORE all other gates as meta-validation of spec documents themselves. Checks: (1) No mojibake/emoji encoding (ASCII-only for shell compatibility), (2) No "localhost" references (must use 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0), (3) Constitution references use non-versioned inheritance format ("Inherited from Agent 0" not "v4.x"), (4) Document End version matches filename, (5) Cross-reference versions consistent (Agent 6 v50, Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current)), (6) Assumption Register sections present. BLOCKING gate - prevents spec drift from causing code generation failures. Constitution reference updated across all agents to eliminate version cascade. Mojibake cleaned for shell script compatibility. Expected: Spec stack validated before any code generation begins, eliminating spec-driven failures. Cross-references: Agent 0 v4.5 (constitution inheritance model), Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current) (Phase 0.0 spec lint).

**NEW in v44:** Added 4 prevention-first gates from Foundry v32 audit analysis. Gate #49 (verify-replit-deployment.sh) validates .replit file structure preventing deployment blockers. Gate #50 (verify-endpoint-paths.sh) checks API paths match spec exactly (not just count) preventing 16 path mismatches from Foundry v32. Gate #51 (verify-dev-script-concurrent.sh) validates concurrent server startup preventing dev script issues. Gate #52 (verify-port-consistency.sh) cross-checks ALL port references preventing 3 port mismatch issues. Enhanced Gate #18 (verify-vite-config.sh) now validates watch config, host binding, proxy port cross-reference. Prevention paradigm: Phase 0 creates mandatory files -> validates BEFORE Phase 1 -> progressive verification during generation. Expected: 23 Foundry v32 issues -> 0 issues with v44 gates. Cross-references Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current) (Phase 0), Agent 6 v50 (Patterns 80-82), Agent 8 v41 (detection patterns).

**NEW in v43:** Added 20 verification scripts from Agent 8 v40 high-impact patterns. Defense-in-depth strategy: Layer 1 (48 scripts catch 99.5% of issues), Layer 2 (Agent 8 audit 0.5%), Layer 3 (Auto-fix). Scripts prevent: N+1 queries (Pattern 5), SQL injection (Pattern 19), missing auth (Patterns 15,51,68), data leaks (Patterns 9,61), performance issues (Patterns 5,42,56), security vulnerabilities (Patterns 19,47,51), infrastructure problems (Patterns 35,38). All scripts have mechanical verification (grep/find/count). Cross-references Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current) (concurrent execution + auto-fix), Agent 6 v50 (service-first architecture), Agent 8 v40 (comprehensive audit).

**NEW in v42:** verify-route-service-contract.sh, verify-service-stubs.sh, and verify-mandatory-files.sh enable service-first architecture validation. Validates routes match Agent 4 v35.1 Section 6 service contracts (import paths, function names, parameters). Detects stub implementations (always throw, TODOs). Validates ALL mandatory files (24 base + dynamic counts from Agents 3-5). Addresses Foundry v31 root causes: route-service coordination (59%), stubs (11%), missing files (4%). Prevents 25/27 issues (96% reduction). Cross-references Agent 4 v35.1 Section 6, Agent 6 v50 Patterns 76-79, Agent 8 v39.

**NEW in v41:** verify-template-extraction.sh and verify-template-completeness.sh validate pattern templates exist and are production-ready BEFORE implementation starts. Ensures all 10 required templates (response.ts, validation.ts, errorHandler.ts, auth.ts, ErrorBoundary.tsx, vite.config.ts, .env.example, health-endpoint.ts, transaction-wrapper.ts, seed-admin.ts) are present, >20 lines each, with zero TODOs/placeholders. Prevents "use response helpers" interpretation ambiguity. Shifts from reactive detection to proactive prevention. Cross-references Agent 6 v47 Section 8 (Reference Implementations), Pattern 33 (Template Extraction), Pattern 34 (Template Completeness).

**NEW in v40:** verify-env-example.sh, verify-network-binding.sh, verify-file-upload-security.sh, verify-transactions.sh (enhanced), and verify-auth-context.sh validate production readiness. Addresses ALL 9 audit findings: CRIT-001 (missing .env.example), CRIT-002 (network binding), CRIT-004 (MIME validation), HIGH-001/HIGH-002 (transaction wrappers), HIGH-004 (auth context). Complete audit coverage with automated prevention.

**NEW in v39:** verify-specs.sh validates specification documents BEFORE implementation (pre-flight check). Ensures API Contract and UI Spec arithmetic is correct. Cross-references Agent 4 v34 Section 1.5 and Agent 5 v32 Page Inventory.

**NEW in v38:** verify-endpoint-count.sh, verify-package-scripts.sh, and verify-console-logs.sh enforce Agent 4 v33 endpoint verification and Agent 6 v44 Patterns 24-26.

**NEW in v37:** verify-vite-config.sh and verify-error-boundary.sh enforce Agent 2 v30 ADR-009, ADR-012 and Agent 6 v43 PROHIBITED PATTERNS #7-8, Pattern 23.

### Gate #53: verify-spec-stack.sh (NEW v45)

**Purpose:** Meta-validation of specification documents before code generation begins

**When to Run:** BEFORE Phase 0 in Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current) (pre-pre-flight validation)

**What It Validates:**
1. ASCII-only encoding (no mojibake/emoji: [OK]?[WARN]--)
2. No "localhost" usage (must use 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0)
3. Constitution inheritance format ("Inherited from Agent 0" not "vX.X")
4. Document End versions match filenames
5. Cross-reference version consistency (Agent 6 v50, Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current), Agent 8 v41)
6. Assumption Register sections present (optional check)

**Script Implementation:**

## SECTION 4: LOGGING STANDARDS

**[GUIDANCE]** Logging guidelines for development vs production environments.

### 4.1 Acceptable Console Usage (UPDATED v34)

**[HIGH] STRICT LIMIT: <10 total console statements across entire codebase**

**Only 4 Categories Allowed:**

**1. Server Startup (Development Only):**
```typescript
// [OK] OK: Server startup information (1-2 statements)
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  console.log(`Server running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}`);
}
```

**2. Error Handler (Console.error Only):**
```typescript
// [OK] OK: Error logging in global error handler (1-2 statements)
export function errorHandler(err: any, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.error('Error:', {
    message: err.message,
    stack: err.stack,
    url: req.url,
    method: req.method
  });
  // ... send error response
}
```

**3. Job Processor Lifecycle (Start/Stop Only):**
```typescript
// [OK] OK: Job processor status (2 statements max)
export function startJobProcessor(): void {
  console.log('Job processor started');
  setInterval(pollAndProcessJobs, POLL_INTERVAL);
}

// On shutdown
console.log('Job processor stopped');
```

**4. Seed Scripts (Results Only):**
```typescript
// [OK] OK: Seed script results (3-5 statements)
// scripts/seed-admin.ts
console.log('[OK] Admin user created');
console.log('  Email: admin@example.com');
console.log('  Password: admin123');
console.log('  [WARN]  IMPORTANT: Change password after first login!');
```

**FORBIDDEN Patterns:**
```typescript
// [X] FORBIDDEN: Debug logging
console.log('Processing data:', data);           // Remove entirely
console.log('User object:', user);               // Remove entirely
console.log('Request received:', req.body);      // Remove entirely

// [X] FORBIDDEN: Non-blocking operation failures
sendEmail(user.email, template)
  .catch(err => console.error('Email failed:', err));  // Use proper error handling

// [X] FORBIDDEN: Function entry/exit
console.log('Starting function...');              // Remove entirely
console.log('Completed');                         // Remove entirely

// [X] FORBIDDEN: Variable dumps
console.log('Config:', config);                   // Remove entirely
console.log('Environment:', process.env);         // Remove entirely

// [X] FORBIDDEN: Sensitive data logging
console.log('User password:', password);          // NEVER log credentials
console.log('API key:', apiKey);                  // NEVER log secrets
console.log('JWT token:', token);                 // NEVER log tokens
```

### 4.2 Logging Quality Targets (UPDATED v34)

**[HIGH] STRICT LIMITS (aligned with Agent 6 v40 Pattern 7):**
- **Production: <10 console statements (STRICT LIMIT)**
- **Development: <20 console statements (WARNING THRESHOLD)**

**Breakdown (Production <10 total):**
1. Server startup (dev only): 1-2 statements
2. Error handler: 1-2 statements
3. Job processor lifecycle: 2 statements
4. Seed scripts: 3-5 statements

**Total:** ~10 maximum

**Target:** Minimal console usage. Production code should have NO debug logging.

### 4.3 Verification Command (UPDATED v34)

```bash
# Count console statements in codebase
CONSOLE_COUNT=$(grep -r "console\.(log|error|warn|info)" server/ client/src/ scripts/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

echo "Console statements: $CONSOLE_COUNT"

# STRICT THRESHOLD v34: Fail at >10 (was warning at >15)
if [ "$CONSOLE_COUNT" -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "[X] FAIL - Excessive logging: $CONSOLE_COUNT statements (strict limit: 10)"
  echo ""
  echo "Allowed usage (only 4 categories):"
  echo "  1. Server startup (dev only): 1-2"
  echo "  2. Error handler: 1-2"
  echo "  3. Job processor lifecycle: 2"
  echo "  4. Seed scripts: 3-5"
  echo ""
  echo "Remove ALL debug logging, request logging, and variable dumps"
  exit 1
elif [ "$CONSOLE_COUNT" -gt 20 ]; then
  echo "[WARN]  WARNING - Development threshold exceeded: $CONSOLE_COUNT (warning: 20)"
  echo "Consider reducing console usage"
else
  echo "[OK] PASS - Acceptable logging level: $CONSOLE_COUNT/10"
fi
```

### 4.4 Future Enhancement: Structured Logging

For production deployments, consider structured logging:

```typescript
// server/lib/logger.ts (optional future enhancement)
import pino from 'pino';

export const logger = pino({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  transport: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
    ? { target: 'pino-pretty' }
    : undefined
});

// Usage
logger.info({ projectId }, 'Project created');
logger.error({ err, jobId }, 'Job processing failed');
logger.warn({ userId }, 'Rate limit exceeded');
```

**Benefits:**
- Structured JSON output
- Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Easy to parse and analyze
- Production-ready performance

**When to implement:**
- Application reaches production
- Need centralized logging (e.g., CloudWatch, Datadog)
- Team size grows (need log analysis)

### 4.5 Forbidden Patterns

```typescript
// [X] NEVER: Passwords/secrets in logs
console.log('Login attempt:', { email, password });  // FORBIDDEN

// [X] NEVER: Full request/response objects (may contain sensitive data)
console.log('Request:', req);                        // FORBIDDEN
console.log('Response:', res);                       // FORBIDDEN

// [X] NEVER: PII without redaction
console.log('User data:', user);                     // May contain email, phone, etc.

// [X] NEVER: API keys, tokens, credentials
console.log('Config:', config);                      // May contain secrets
```

## SECTION 5: VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY (NEW v35)

**Purpose:** Establish verification-first development as the standard approach. Verification checks are written FIRST, then implementation steps are designed to guarantee those checks pass.

**Reference:** Agent 6 v41 Pattern 22 (Verification-First Development)

### Principle: Verification-First Development

**Anti-Pattern (DO NOT DO THIS):**
```markdown
## Phase X
- Step 1: Create directories
- Step 2: Create files
- Step 3: Configure middleware
[Later] Verification: Check if everything exists
```

**Correct Pattern (ALWAYS DO THIS):**
```markdown
## Phase X

### SUCCESS CRITERIA (Define FIRST):
```bash
# These checks MUST pass
[ -d "client/src/pages" ] || exit 1
[ -f "server/index.ts" ] || exit 1
grep -q "helmet()" server/index.ts || exit 1
```

### IMPLEMENTATION (Designed to Pass Criteria):
Step 1: Create directories
Step 2: Verify directories exist
Step 3: Create files with required content
Step 4: Verify content exists

[STOP] GATE: Run verification. If fails, STOP.
```

### Process Flow

1. **Define Success Criteria First**
   - Write verification checks showing what MUST exist
   - Be specific: exact directories, files, configuration patterns
   - Include counts, not just existence

2. **Write Implementation Steps Second**
   - Design steps that create exactly what verification checks
   - Each step should map to verification criteria
   - Include inline verification after each major step

3. **Add Blocking Gates Third**
   - Explicit gate: "Run verification script"
   - Explicit stop instruction: "If exit code ? 0, DO NOT PROCEED"
   - No ambiguity about what happens on failure

### Enhanced Verification Categories

#### 1. Structural Verification (Existence + Counts)

**Purpose:** Verify directories and files exist with exact counts.

**Template:**
```bash
# Directory existence
[ -d "client/src/pages" ] || { echo "[X] Missing pages"; exit 1; }
[ -d "server/services" ] || { echo "[X] Missing services"; exit 1; }

# Exact counts (not minimum)
CLIENT_DIRS=$(ls -1 client/src 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
[ "$CLIENT_DIRS" -eq 5 ] || { echo "[X] Expected 5 dirs, found $CLIENT_DIRS"; exit 1; }

# File existence
[ -f "server/index.ts" ] || { echo "[X] Missing server/index.ts"; exit 1; }
```

**Critical:** Use exact matching (=), NOT minimum (?). If spec says 5 directories, verify exactly 5.

#### 2. Content Verification (Configuration + Usage)

**Purpose:** Verify middleware is CONFIGURED and APPLIED, not just installed or imported.

**Template:**
```bash
# Security middleware - check import + usage
grep -q "import helmet" server/index.ts || { echo "[X] helmet not imported"; exit 1; }
grep -q "app.use(helmet())" server/index.ts || { echo "[X] helmet not applied"; exit 1; }

# Rate limiting - check configuration + application
grep -q "rateLimit" server/index.ts || { echo "[X] rateLimit not imported"; exit 1; }
grep -q "app.use('/api'.*Limiter)" server/index.ts || { echo "[X] rateLimit not applied"; exit 1; }

# JWT - check fail-fast pattern (no fallbacks)
grep -E "JWT_SECRET.*(\|\||::)" server/ -r && { echo "[X] JWT has fallback"; exit 1; }
```

**Critical:** Check USAGE, not just presence. Middleware must be applied with `app.use()`.

#### 3. Placeholder Detection (Comments + Content + Structure)

**Purpose:** Detect all forms of placeholder content, not just TODO comments.

**Template:**
```bash
# 1. Comment-based placeholders
grep -rE "TODO|FIXME|PLACEHOLDER" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" \
  client/ server/ && { echo "[X] Found TODO comments"; exit 1; }

# 2. Content-based placeholders
grep -rE "coming soon|coming in Phase|not implemented" -i \
  --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" \
  client/ server/ && { echo "[X] Found placeholder text"; exit 1; }

# 3. Structural placeholders (inline components)
grep -E "^function (Dashboard|Login|Register)" client/src/App.tsx && \
  { echo "[X] Inline components found - use separate files"; exit 1; }

# 4. Empty function bodies
grep -rE "{\s*}\s*$" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" \
  client/src/ server/ | grep -v "onClick.*{}" && \
  { echo "[X] Empty function bodies found"; exit 1; }
```

**Critical:** "Complete" means functionally complete, not just syntactically valid.

#### 4. Usage Verification (Install + Import + Use)

**Purpose:** Verify dependencies are installed AND imported AND used in code.

**Template:**
```bash
# Function to verify full usage chain
verify_dependency() {
  local PKG=$1
  local FILE=$2
  local IMPORT_PATTERN=$3
  local USAGE_PATTERN=$4
  
  # Check all three levels
  grep -q "\"$PKG\"" package.json || { echo "[X] $PKG not installed"; return 1; }
  grep -q "$IMPORT_PATTERN" "$FILE" || { echo "[X] $PKG not imported"; return 1; }
  grep -q "$USAGE_PATTERN" "$FILE" || { echo "[X] $PKG not used"; return 1; }
  
  echo "[OK] $PKG verified"
}

# Apply to all critical dependencies
verify_dependency "helmet" "server/index.ts" "import.*helmet" "helmet()"
verify_dependency "bcrypt" "server/services/auth.service.ts" "import.*bcrypt" "bcrypt\.(hash|compare)"
```

**Critical:** Three-level check prevents "installed but unused" and "imported but not configured".

### Verification Pattern Templates

#### Template 1: Directory Scaffolding Verification (Agent 6 v41 Pattern 18)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Verify all directories exist with exact counts

echo "Verifying directory structure..."

# Client directories
for DIR in components pages hooks lib types; do
  [ -d "client/src/$DIR" ] || { echo "[X] Missing client/src/$DIR"; exit 1; }
done

# Server directories
for DIR in db/schema db/migrations lib errors middleware services routes workers; do
  [ -d "server/$DIR" ] || { echo "[X] Missing server/$DIR"; exit 1; }
done

# Count verification
CLIENT_DIRS=$(ls -1 client/src | wc -l)
[ "$CLIENT_DIRS" -eq 5 ] || { echo "[X] Wrong client/src count: $CLIENT_DIRS"; exit 1; }

SERVER_DIRS=$(ls -1 server | wc -l)
[ "$SERVER_DIRS" -eq 8 ] || { echo "[X] Wrong server count: $SERVER_DIRS"; exit 1; }

echo "[OK] Directory structure verified"
```

#### Template 2: Security Middleware Verification (Agent 6 v41 Pattern 19)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Verify security middleware is configured and applied

echo "Verifying security middleware..."

# Helmet - import + usage
grep -q "import helmet from 'helmet'" server/index.ts || \
  { echo "[X] helmet not imported"; exit 1; }
grep -q "app.use(helmet())" server/index.ts || \
  { echo "[X] helmet not applied"; exit 1; }

# Rate limiting - import + usage
grep -q "import.*rateLimit.*from 'express-rate-limit'" server/index.ts || \
  { echo "[X] express-rate-limit not imported"; exit 1; }
grep -q "app.use('/api'.*Limiter)" server/index.ts || \
  { echo "[X] rate limiter not applied to /api"; exit 1; }
grep -q "app.use('/api/auth'.*Limiter)" server/index.ts || \
  { echo "[X] stricter limiter not applied to /api/auth"; exit 1; }

echo "[OK] Security middleware verified"
```

#### Template 3: Dependency Usage Verification (Agent 6 v41 Pattern 20)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Verify dependencies are installed, imported, AND used

verify_dependency() {
  local PKG=$1
  local FILE=$2
  local IMPORT=$3
  local USAGE=$4
  
  grep -q "\"$PKG\"" package.json || { echo "[X] $PKG: Not in package.json"; return 1; }
  grep -q "$IMPORT" "$FILE" || { echo "[X] $PKG: Not imported in $FILE"; return 1; }
  grep -q "$USAGE" "$FILE" || { echo "[X] $PKG: Not used in $FILE"; return 1; }
  
  echo "[OK] $PKG: Verified"
}

# Security
verify_dependency "helmet" "server/index.ts" "import.*helmet" "helmet()"
verify_dependency "express-rate-limit" "server/index.ts" "import.*rateLimit" "rateLimit("

# Authentication
verify_dependency "bcrypt" "server/services/auth.service.ts" "import.*bcrypt" "bcrypt\.(hash|compare)"
verify_dependency "jsonwebtoken" "server/services/auth.service.ts" "import.*jwt" "jwt\.(sign|verify)"

# Database
verify_dependency "drizzle-orm" "server/db/index.ts" "import.*drizzle" "drizzle("
verify_dependency "pg" "server/db/index.ts" "import.*Pool" "new Pool"
```

#### Template 4: Placeholder Content Verification (Agent 6 v41 Pattern 21)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Enhanced placeholder detection

echo "Checking for placeholder content..."
ERRORS=0

# Comment-based
if grep -rE "TODO|FIXME|PLACEHOLDER" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" \
  client/ server/ 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "[X] TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER comments found"
  ERRORS=$((ERRORS+1))
fi

# Content-based

  -i --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" client/ server/ 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "[X] Placeholder content text found"
  ERRORS=$((ERRORS+1))
fi

# Inline page components
if grep -E "^function (Dashboard|Login|Register|Settings|Profile)" \
  client/src/App.tsx 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "[X] Inline page components - must be in client/src/pages/"
  ERRORS=$((ERRORS+1))
fi

# Empty function bodies (except no-op handlers)
if grep -rE "{\s*}\s*$" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" \
  client/src/ server/ 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -v "onClick.*{}" | grep -v "onChange.*{}"; then
  echo "[X] Empty function bodies found"
  ERRORS=$((ERRORS+1))
fi

[ $ERRORS -eq 0 ] || { echo "[X] $ERRORS placeholder categories found"; exit 1; }
echo "[OK] No placeholder content"
```

- ErrorBoundary MUST be class component with `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError`
- App MUST be wrapped in `<ErrorBoundary>` tags
- **Enforced by:** `scripts/verify-vite-config.sh` (Gate #13), `scripts/verify-error-boundary.sh` (Gate #14)

[OK] **Complete count and reference verification (NEW v38)**
- **Reference:** Agent 4 v33 Section 1.4, Agent 6 v44 Patterns 24-26
- Endpoint count MUST exactly match API contract total (not ?, exact =)
- Health endpoint (`app.get('/health')`) counts as +1 to total
- Package.json scripts MUST reference existing files (no dead references)
- Console statements SHOULD be ?5 outside acceptable locations (warning threshold)
- Direct `parseInt(req.params)` or `parseInt(req.query)` FORBIDDEN (use validation utilities)
- **Enforced by:** `scripts/verify-endpoint-count.sh` (Gate #15), `scripts/verify-package-scripts.sh` (Gate #16), `scripts/verify-console-logs.sh` (Gate #17)

### Integration with Phase Development

Every phase specification MUST follow this structure:

```markdown
## Phase X: [Name]

### SUCCESS CRITERIA (Written FIRST):
```bash
# Verification checks that MUST pass
[ -d "..." ] || exit 1
[ -f "..." ] || exit 1
grep -q "..." || exit 1
```

### IMPLEMENTATION (Designed to Pass Criteria):
Step 1: [Action]
Step 2: Verify step 1
Step 3: [Action]
Step 4: Verify step 3

[STOP] BLOCKING GATE:
```bash
bash scripts/verify-phase-X.sh
# If exit code ? 0, DO NOT PROCEED
# Fix all failures before continuing
```
```

### Validation Approach

**After updating specifications:**

```bash
# 1. Generate code with updated specs
claude-code --specs /docs

# 2. Run Phase 1 verification IMMEDIATELY
npm run verify:phase1

# 3. If it fails, the SPEC is wrong (not Claude Code)
# Fix the spec to provide executable instructions

# 4. Repeat until verification passes on first try
```

**Success Metric:** Claude Code produces code that passes ALL verifications on first attempt with no manual fixes needed.

## ASSUMPTION RESOLUTION

**[CRITICAL]** Review all AR-* assumptions from upstream agents.

| Assumption | Agent | Status | Resolution |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|
| AR-ARCH-001 | Agent 2 | UNRESOLVED | [Decision or acceptance] |
| AR-DATA-001 | Agent 3 | RESOLVED | [How resolved] |
| AR-API-001 | Agent 4 | ACCEPTED | [Why accepted] |

**Rules:**
- UNRESOLVED assumptions block deployment
- ACCEPTED assumptions documented in risks
- RESOLVED assumptions closed

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

5. **Schema manifest verification (exact table count) - NEW v33**
6. **Transaction wrapper verification - NEW v33**
7. **Navigation component verification - NEW v33**

**Quality Standards (v34 - UPDATED):**
- **Code completeness: 0 TODO/FIXME/placeholder statements**
- **Endpoint count: EXACT match to spec**
- **Schema count: EXACT table-to-file mapping**
- **Transactions: 100% coverage on required functions**
- **Navigation: All feature groups ?3 pages covered**

- Only 4 allowed categories: server startup (dev), error handler, job lifecycle, seed scripts
- NEVER log passwords, secrets, tokens, PII
- Consider structured logging for production

**Quality Targets (v33 - UPDATED):**
- Test coverage: 80%+ for critical paths
- Issue count: **<3 (down from 7-15 with v26-v33 specs)**
- Deployment verification: **100% pass rate on all 11 scripts**
- Code completeness: **0 TODO/placeholder code**
- Count accuracy: **Exact matches (not approximate)**

---

## PROMPT MAINTENANCE

**When updating:**
- Update version number (v33 -> v34)
- Add "What Changed" to version history
- Update Constitution reference if changed
- Run Hygiene Gate (Constitution Section L)
- Verify all verification scripts documented
- Check new verification scripts added to gate checklist
- Ensure exact count requirements specified

---

## DOCUMENT END

**Agent 7 v45 Complete**

**What Changed in v45 (Spec Stack Integrity):**
- **SPEC STACK INTEGRITY:** Added Gate #53 (verify-spec-stack.sh) for pre-flight validation of specification documents
- Gate #53 validates BEFORE Phase 0: ASCII-only encoding, no localhost, constitution inheritance format, Document End versions, cross-reference consistency, Assumption Register presence
- Total verification scripts: 52 -> 53 (+1 meta-validation gate)
- Updated constitution reference to non-versioned inheritance format (Agent 0 v4.5 compliance)
- Removed mojibake encoding: replaced all checkmarks/crosses/emoji with ASCII equivalents ([OK], [X], [WARN])
- Updated cross-references: Agent 6 v48 -> v49 throughout document
- Addresses Foundry v32 spec drift root cause: 23 code generation errors from inconsistent specs
- Completes prevention-first framework: spec validation (Gate #53) -> file creation (Phase 0) -> progressive gates (52 gates) -> deployment
- Meta-protection: validates the validators (spec stack itself checked before validating code)
- Expected outcome: Spec stack passes Gate #53, eliminating all spec-driven failures before code generation
- Cross-references: Agent 0 v4.5 (constitution inheritance), Claude Code Master Build Prompt (current) (Phase 0.0 spec lint), Agent 6 v50 (Patterns 80-82), Agent 8 v41 (detection patterns)

**Lines:** ~1,840 (complete, AI-optimized, ASCII-only encoding)
**Status:** Production-ready
